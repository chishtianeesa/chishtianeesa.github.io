# Pause, reflect, and smile

At Housing I delivered 2 products, led 3 engineering teams and met all targets. At BrowserStack, I built Enterprise products, restructured BrowserStackâ€™s information architecture, and built the internal pricing and billing systems.

These experiences have accelerated my learning in product, UX, software development, growth, analytics, prioritization, leadership and stakeholder management. On the side I  have also worked on projects for products as diverse as talent recruiting (Shortlist), and fashion curation (Roposo) - a great way for me to apply learnings from one context to another.

A lot of encouragement along the way helped a great deal.
