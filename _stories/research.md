# Research won me over

## Security and graphs were my fields

Under Dr. Shekhar Verma, IIIT-Allahabadâ€™s expert on security and networks, I worked on video steganography. From literature survey, to working on a method, to concluding it with documentation, the process was compelling. My paper being published validated the work. And it felt nice. The next project on noisy sensor networks culminated in experimental results proving our hypothesis. Being proved right had its own satisafction. It also furthered my intent to research. After all, it was fun.
