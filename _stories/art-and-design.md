# Art and Design

As the years, cities and people went by I remained quiet and reflective. Art became my medium of choice: paper never talked to fast, or too loud. At NIFT, where I studied, the curriculum focused on the origin of products, and the skills that bring them to life. Before designing a pattern for a weave, I had to make my own loom. While I enjoyed experimenting with methods, materials and scale, I found myself inclined towards what I now know as UX design.
