# BrowserStack for Enterprise

## summary

BrowserStack is a cloud based website and mobile app testing product that started out with a self-service SaaS model. While this model gave BrowserStack massive organic growth, churn remained high because freelancers accounted for 85% of the customer base. BrowserStack now wants to expand within organisations to drive up retention and increase per account revenue. The goal is to make 80% of the revenue from 20% of the customer base. As part of this vision, my team built BrowserStack’s enterprise edition - BrowserStack for Enterprise.


## What makes a good enterprise product?

### Customer research

Soon after completing the VR experience, we had issues where due to a small team size, it took us up to a month to complete a single VR build. We needed to productise this process and reduce the build time significantly. Identifying that most interior 3D models were made through a similar process, and that we could modularize the model creation, we created a build system operated through a web front end by an operator, who could design the house and send it for processing to Unity, which created and launched the experience as an app. The build time was cut down from multiple weeks to less than a day, allowing for much higher delivery potential and scalability. The following needs emerged:
1. How can we optimize our testing on BrowserStack?
2. I want to upgrade, but we need to show we've tested extensively.
3. Team management, role based access
4. Security is a massive concern
5. Professional services

## Features identified

### Single Sign-on

The rails backend translated data, and connected the frontend to the Unity build system. Connected to Housing’s backend, the system automatically added builder metadata and organized the model data according to its categories. It also acted as a load balancer, managing Unity jobs over multiple build servers.

### Usage Analytics

The Unity build system was the monster supporting the entire build process. The system handled all the tasks of actually creating a 3D model according to specifications, furnishing it, lighting, baking and processing it into a final product. The build system performed the following steps procedurally:

- Coverage
- Frequency
