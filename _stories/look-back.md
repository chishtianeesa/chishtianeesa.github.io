# Pause, reflect, and smile

In my first (almost) three years as a product manager, I built a recommendation engine, phased out a primary business vertical, built a SaaS Enterprise product, overhauled the information architecture of a $40 Million SaaS company, and worked extensively on pricing and billing systems. 

I also worked on consulting projects for products as diverse as talent recruiting (Shortlist), and fashion discovery and curation (Roposo).

These experiences have accelerated my learning in product, UX, software development, analytics, prioritization, leadership and stakeholder management. I have also found inspiring mentors, patient peers and loving friends.
