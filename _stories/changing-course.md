# Changing course

I began my career as a designer, at India’s largest apparel manufacturer where an incident on the shopfloor inspired me to explore interface design. As I researched this, I learned that good design can’t be idiosyncratic, it must have mass appeal and intelligibility.

I learned the fundamental of UX research and design at Kaaryah, a fashion-tech startup.
However, since Kaaryah was operating on a small scale, my learning plateaued and I was eager for more. I decided to go to business school.
