# The road ahead

I care deeply about inclusive design. It is wonderful when I find technology that is truly inclusive. Our biases determine whether we care enough to recognise some problems as meaningful problems that must be addressed. I am constantly trying to overcome my biases and think outside my own frame of reference while building products.

In the future I see myself working as a product consultant, helping companies build inclusive products.

Someday, when I have a story to tell, I would also love to work on a graphic novel.
