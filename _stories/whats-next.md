# The road ahead

I deeply care about inclusive design. It is wonderful when I find technology that is truly inclusive. Our biases determine whether we care enough to recognise some problems as meaningful problems that must be addressed.

I am constantly trying to overcome my biases and think outside my own frame of reference while building products.

Someday, when I have a story to tell, I would also love to work on a graphic novel.
