# Lessons from the loom

As years, cities and people went by I remained quiet and reflective. Art became my medium of choice.

At NIFT, where I studied apparel design, the curriculum focused on the origin of products, and the skills that bring them to life. Before designing a pattern for a weave, I had to make my own loom!

These experiences made me curious about the people, skills and processes that touched every product I used.
