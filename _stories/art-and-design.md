# Art and Design

As the years, cities and people went by I became quiet and reflective. Art became my favorite medium of expression. I studied design at NIFT, where the curriculum focused on the origin of products and the skills that bring them to life - before designing a pattern for a weave, I had to make my own loom.

While I enjoyed experimenting with methods, materials and scale, I felt an affinity for UX design, that I could not articulate and found little opportunity to develop.
