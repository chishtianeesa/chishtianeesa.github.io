# The Puppet Makers

I was born in Kashmir in the winter of 1987, to doctor parents who demonised sugar, fries and all things nice.

My elder sister and I were terribly curious kids. We would dig up mud from our front yard to build elaborate cities inhabited by wriggling worms and uprooted weeds. When we couldnâ€™t grasp the concept of non-biodegradability, we buried a plastic box with paper dolls inside and agreed to dig it up 20 years later. Of course, the dolls had enough food, water and books for their time underground.

Fascinated by theatre and puppetry, we wrote scripts and made our own puppets. Our very first play was about a young woman named Bilkees and her struggle to find a cure for her itchy eyes.

My childhood was magical.
