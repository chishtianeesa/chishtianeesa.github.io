# Once upon a time

I was born in the valley of Kashmir in the winter of 1987 to physician parents who demonised sugar, fries and all things nice.

My sister and I were curious and inventive, always up to something. We built elaborate cities from mud, complete with sewer systems and market squares. When we learnt about non-biodegradability, we decided to put it to the test. We buried paper dolls in  plastic box, meaning to dig it up in 20 years. The dolls, of course, had enough food, water and books for their time underground.
We wrote scripts and made puppets out of garbage bags, badminton racquets and twigs. Our first play was about Bilkees, a young woman attempting to remedy her very, very itchy eyes with a carrot.

We had a world of our own, inaccessible to those who did not know the secret language.
