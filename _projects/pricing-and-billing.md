## Problems

## Problem #1    :   The Big Pricing Migration

### What was the problem?
We were maintaining three pricing versions to support 22,000 legacy customers. As we experimented with pricing, and launched plans and products, maintenance got increasingly difficult, feature releases slowed down, and new product adoption suffered because new products/plans were visible only to customers on the latest pricing version - so, legacy customers missed out!

### What were the challenges?
- Different value metrics
- Different billing cycles
- a la carte versus bundled/combined plans
- Active, expiring, expired
- Feature access activated by random flags

### What were the risks?
- iMRR loss
- Churn

### What were the success metrics?

- Support tickets
- Customer churn (plan cancellations)
- iMRR loss (incremental monthly recurring revenue). Projected iMRR retention: 65%
- New product adoption (% groups that purchased any of the new products)


### How did we solve it?

The solution is to force migrate all 11,398 V1 groups to equivalent V3 plans without any price increase. The migration will also apply to expired groups. The migration will be handled in-product for all self-service groups and handled via personal involvement for renewal Ops.

We split the migration into four phases:
- V2 to V3 Migration (Online business)
- V1 to V3 migration (Online business)
- 2Checkout to Stripe Migration
- V1, V2 to V3 Migration (Renewals)
