# API? huh?

Post business school I joined the product team at Housing.com. I was the only non-tech Product Manager and I recall my first day, where a developer responded to my question with - “Easy, we can use the Google Maps API” - and I just stared blankly at him.

I realised quickly that I had a LOT of catching up to do. I dedicated weekends to take online courses on programming, databases, analytics and Information Architecture. I read the most highly recommended books such as Women, Fire and dangerous things. I replaced music with audiobooks and podcasts.

It all paid off when in just 4 months, I went on to lead a 15 member cross-functional team to work on a recommendation engine to address Housing’s high percentage of dead-end searches.
