# API? huh?

Post business school I joined the product team at Housing.com. I was the only non-tech Product Manager. On my first day, I remember staring blankly when a developer mentioned  “Google Maps API”. I had a lot of catching up to do. I spent weekends taking  online courses on programming, databases, analytics and information architecture. I read as much as I could. Music was replaced with audiobooks and podcasts. In  just 4 months, I was successfully leading a 15 member cross-functional team to work on a recommendation engine to address Housing’s disproportionately high percentage of dead-end searches.
