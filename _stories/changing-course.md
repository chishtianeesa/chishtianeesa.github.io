# Changing course

I began my career as a designer, at Indiaâ€™s largest apparel manufacturer, where I worked under severe cost constraints. This taught me the importance of frugal design; how to pare down products to their simplest and most elegant iterations.

A particularly graphic incident on the shop floor inspired me learn about interaction design, and pursue a more expansive design practice.

I learned the fundamentals of UX research and design at Kaaryah, a fashion-tech startup. However, since Kaaryah was operating on a small scale, my learning plateaued and I was eager for more. I decided to go to business school.
