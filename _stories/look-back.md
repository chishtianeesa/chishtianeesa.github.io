# Pause, reflect, and smile

After building a product and phasing out another, I left Housing to join  BrowserStack, a leading SaaS product for browser and app testing. At BrowserStack, I built the Enterprise product, overhauled the web platform's information architecture, and re-built the internal pricing and billing systems.

I also worked on consulting projects for products as diverse as talent recruiting (Shortlist), and fashion discovery and curation (Roposo).

These experiences have accelerated my learning in product, UX, software development, analytics, prioritization, leadership and stakeholder management. I have also found inspiring mentors, patient peers and loving friends.
