# VR Backend

## This is the actual content though.

I led the VR team at Housing, one of India’s best tech startups. We made the first commercially scalable real estate VR product in India, includin While looking for a mentor for my semester project, I came across Dr. Verma, IIIT-Allahabad’s resident expert on security and networks. Under his tutelage, we decided to work on video steganography, a largely unexplored domain. From the literature survey, all the way to proposing our method and testing it out, the process was very instructional. The final step, writing a paper detailing the work and our findings, published under IEEE’s CSNT, was very motivating to further research.
