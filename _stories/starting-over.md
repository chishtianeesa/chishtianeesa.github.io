# Starting over

I began my career as a product designer, at Indiaâ€™s largest apparel manufacturer where an incident on the shopfloor inspired me to explore UX design. As I read more, I learned that good design is attentive to the ways in which humans and objects interact. It has to be relevant to large numbers of people. I was inspired to pursue a more expansive design practice.

I transitioned to UX design at Kaaryah, a fashion-tech startup. My time at Kaaryah helped me learn the fundamentals of UX research and design, but more importantly it taught me that good design is good business and not an indulgence. Kaaryah was operating on a small scale. As my learning plateaued, I decided to go to business school. The combination of academic and experiential learning at business school was  invaluable to me.
