# API? huh?

At business school, I benefited immensely from a combination of academic and experiential learning, and came to understand the numerous intersections between the business and tech worlds. After graduating, I joined the product team at Housing.com. I was the only non-tech Product Manager. On my first day, I stared blankly at the mention of “Google Maps API”.

I dedicated every waking moment to catching up.

Four months in, I was leading a team of six engineers and designers to work on a recommendation engine, to maximize successful searches on Housing.com.
