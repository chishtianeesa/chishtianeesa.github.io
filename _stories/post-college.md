# My work is in multiple fields

## Networks, Polygons, VR and Security

I worked on the PGW node of the LTE backend while in Cisco. After a year of solving bugs, I moved to Housing to experience web application development. My first project involved exploring scalable geo-tech and creating an isoline routing engine. It had a coversion rate of 60%! My next problem: to crawl the polygons of all Indian cities. Exploitng a hidden API in Googleâ€™s map maker service, I created a distributed, state aware crawler. Post the crawler, I moved on to VR, and as they say, we're full circle!
