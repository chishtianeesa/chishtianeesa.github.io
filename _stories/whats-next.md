# The road ahead

I think of myself as an artist, and technology as my medium, one that has the power to change people for the better. Whether by holding out opportunities that might otherwise not be available, or by making relevant information easier to understand  and process.

In the future, I want to continue to tell stories that can change the way people look at minorities, women, equality and inclusiveness.
