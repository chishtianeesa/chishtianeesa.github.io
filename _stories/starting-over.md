# Changing course

I began my career as a designer, at India’s largest apparel manufacturer where an incident on the shopfloor inspired me to explore interface design. As I researched this, I learned that good design can’t be idiosyncratic, it must have mass appeal and intelligibility. I finally had a name for the ideas I kept turning over in my head: Human Computer Interaction!

I learned the fundamental of UX research and design at Kaaryah, a fashion-tech startup. I was also introduced to product management, but I didn’t have the necessary background to pursue it. I applied to the Indian school of business, where I was accepted with a scholarship.
