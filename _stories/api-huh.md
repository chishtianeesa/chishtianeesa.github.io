# API? huh?

After business school I joined the product team at Housing.com. I was the only non-tech Product Manager. On my first day, I stared blankly at the mention of “Google Maps API”.

I dedicated every waking moment to catching up.

Four months in, I was leading a team of six engineers and designers to work on a recommendation engine, to address Housing’s disproportionately high percentage of dead-end searches.
