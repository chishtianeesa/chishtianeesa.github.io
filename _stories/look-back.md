# Pause, reflect, and smile

At Housing I launched 2 products, led 3 engineering teams, and made friends for life. At BrowserStack, I built Enterprise products, restructured BrowserStackâ€™s information architecture, and re-built the internal pricing and billing systems.These experiences have accelerated my learning in product, UX, software development, growth, analytics, prioritization, leadership and stakeholder management.

I also worked on independent  projects for products as diverse as talent recruiting (Shortlist), and fashion curation (Roposo).
