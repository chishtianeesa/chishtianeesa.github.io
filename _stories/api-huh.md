# API? huh?

After business school I joined the product team at Housing.com. I was the only non-tech Product Manager. On my first day, I stared blankly at the mention of “Google Maps API”. I spent weekends taking online courses on programming, databases, analytics and information architecture. Music was replaced with audiobooks and podcasts. I read as much as I could.

In just 4 months, I was leading a 15 member cross-functional team working on a recommendation engine to address Housing’s disproportionately high percentage of dead-end searches.
