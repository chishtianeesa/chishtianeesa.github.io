# The road ahead

I deeply care about inclusive design. It is wonderful when I find technology that is truly inclusive. Our biases determine whether we care enough to recognise some problems as meaningful problems that must be addressed. Up until recently, Siri didn’t even recognise “rape” as a problem. I took an evaluation as part of *Project inclusive* which helped me uncover my own biases - some very shocking ones!

I am constantly trying to overcome my biases and think outside my own frame of reference while building products.

Someday, when I have a story to tell, I would also love to work on a graphic novel.
